Yes. or No.

What so ever, an incident from my diary answer this as "Yes"

#Diary

[ A Day before few months ]

Opened eyes at 6 a.m [ Forgot to thank God!! ]

Felt rays of the sun, listened the peaceful voice of birds, and day started with hopes and dreams.

Finishing routine, I kicked my bike with "Bye" on lips and "Mummy's beautiful eyes in mind".

En route from my home to office, I found my Living-Being #2 & #3

[ Living-Being #2 & #3 ?? ]

As one of my weekly goals, I have decided to help any living being from whom I will never get help in back. Generally they are strangers. 
And I tag them as Living-Being.

Living-Being #2

A guy near bus-stand was looking tense and in hurry with showing his hand in a sign for lift. I stopped my bike near him.

He sat on bike as fast as he could and gear changed to move on.

He: "Narol" (Place in Ahmedabad)

Me: Okay.

There was no conversation between us on bike. And I better thought to give him some time for relaxing. As his station arrived, I stopped my bike.

He: Thank you very much ! (He started walking in a hurry)

At the time my lips were busy in completing formality to say "Most Welcome" ,
My mind was observing a beggar who was coming near me. He came at me and demand for some food.

White-Gray uncombed hair, eyes that were trying hard to open, Slippers, Gandhi bag, Stick for support, and wrinkle skin.

He again demanded some food.

I gave him 10 Rs from my wallet as I did not have any food with me.

He took money. And started analyzing it as if I have gave him something which he had never seen before. And finally he shouted,

10 Rs. ?? Wah..Wahh..h...

Ye.....Hurray...

ye....(His both hands were blessing me on air..)

And he started dancing like someone who don't care about the world and his surroundings. I had never seen someone so happy in my entire life.

( And for 10 Rs ??? Never.)

I moved on for the company. The scene of his dance and immeasurable happiness was spinning in my mind. 
It made me smile for 10-15 mins towards the road. I felt something amazing around the area of my heart.

That feeling was amazing and I had never experienced it before. 
After sometimes it felt me so much emotional that drops of liquid we recognized as tears came out of my eyes.

Tears of Happiness.

Yes. For the first time I had tears of happiness in my eyes. As I re-visualized the whole scene at night, I concluded,

The real happiness is seeing someone so much happy because of you.

Again, Can money buy happiness ?

What I think now from my own experience is

Yes. Money can buy happiness if it is used at right place and right time.
